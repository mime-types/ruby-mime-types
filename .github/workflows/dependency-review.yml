# Dependency Review Action
#
# This Action will scan dependency manifest files that change as part of a Pull Request,
# surfacing known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the PR. Once
# installed, if the workflow run is marked as required, PRs introducing known-vulnerable
# packages will be blocked from merging.
